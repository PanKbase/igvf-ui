# Exporting Data as TSV - User Guide

## Overview

You can export search results and report data as a Tab-Separated Values (TSV) file. This guide explains how to customize which columns are included in your export.

## Quick Start

1. **Switch to Report View**: Click the table/grid view button (tabular view) to see data in a table format
2. **Select Columns**: Click the "Columns" button to choose which fields to include
3. **Download**: Click "Download metadata as TSV" to export your data

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Navigate to Report View

- Look for the view switcher buttons in the top toolbar
- Click the **table/grid icon** button to switch from list view to report (tabular) view
- The report view displays data in a table format with columns

### Step 2: Customize Columns

1. **Click the "Columns" button** in the toolbar
   - The button is located next to the view switcher buttons
   - It may show an indicator if some columns are currently hidden

2. **In the Columns modal**:
   - Check the boxes next to columns you want to **include** in your export
   - Uncheck boxes for columns you want to **exclude**
   - Use "Show All" to include all available columns
   - Use "Hide All" to exclude all optional columns (ID column will always remain)
   - Note: The **ID column cannot be hidden** and will always be included

3. **Click "Close"** when you're done selecting columns

### Step 3: Download Your Data

1. **Click "Download metadata as TSV"** button
   - The button is located next to the Columns button
   - It includes a download icon and clear text label

2. **Your browser will download the file**
   - The file will be named based on your search query
   - It will be in TSV format (tab-separated values)
   - You can open it in Excel, Google Sheets, or any spreadsheet application

## What Gets Exported?

- **Only visible columns** are included in the TSV export
- The columns you see in the table are the columns that will be exported
- If you hide a column using the Columns button, it won't be in the export
- The ID column is always included, even if you try to hide it

## Tips

- **Preview before exporting**: The table view shows exactly what will be exported
- **Customize for your needs**: Select only the columns relevant to your analysis
- **Save time**: Use "Show All" or "Hide All" to quickly adjust column visibility
- **Multiple exports**: You can export the same data multiple times with different column selections

## Troubleshooting

**Q: I don't see the "Download metadata as TSV" button**
- Make sure you're in **Report view** (table/grid view), not List view
- The download button only appears in report view

**Q: The exported file doesn't include the columns I selected**
- Make sure you clicked "Close" in the Columns modal after making your selections
- Verify the columns are visible in the table before downloading

**Q: How do I know which columns are selected?**
- Look at the table - visible columns are selected
- The Columns button may show an indicator if some columns are hidden
- Open the Columns modal to see the full list and current selections
